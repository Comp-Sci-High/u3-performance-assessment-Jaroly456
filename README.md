1. Why did you pick this API topic?
    I picked this API topic for people who want to know how many teams are in the Japan SV.League. While also learning about the volleyball positions

2. Describe your API and the available data endpoints
    My API gives users information on the Japan volleyball teams for men, and all positions in volleyball. The available endpoints are /docs, /api/volleyball/teams, /api/volleyball/teams/:id, /api/volleyball/positions, and /api/volleyball/positions:idNum. /doc tells you what all the available endpoints are for the user to search. /api/volleyball/teams shows you all teams in the volleyball object, while /api/volleyball/teams/:id shows you the teams individually. /api/volleyball/positions shows all volleyball positions, while /api/volleyball/positions/:idNum shows the positions individually.

3. How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?
    It was an interesting expierence. Building my own API service at this level felt a lot easier than I believe it should be. Which has me a little worried about future coding projects we would have to make
